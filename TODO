* ensure labels in new multi-column controls are being updated appropriately
* SIP stuff
  - Implement sip_volume to use baresip volume instead of rig speaker
* FreqInput widget:
  - Fix typing in the first digit appearing in last digit!
  - while typing, suspend actions on the field and allow typing normally
* Find/fix remaining UI bugs
* Add preamp control
* Add mic gain control
* Add signal bar to SWR widget
* Tune button (ON/OFF/AUTO)
* Add speech for blind users
* VOX controls with visibility controlled by Use VOX toggle (cfg:use_vox)
* Clean up read_rig to update $vfos->{$curr_vfo} and call gtk_ui->update()
* Move GTK GUI update code from Hamlib.pm to update() in GTK_ui.pm
* Fix bug where gridtools is shown when main is hidden/show even when hide_gridtools_too is false
* Make the Gridtools button hide/show (not just iconify) the window...
* Reduce the amount of rig command sent if possible
* Add more verification/error checking
  - gridtools - Confirm if grids are valid or not
  - FreqInput - Add upper/lower bounds from querying hamlib
* Maybe make blocks able to be pulled out into the own window or returned to main window?
  - Add option to move the meters to a floating window
* Add a widget (scale/slider?) under the freq selector to allow chosing the step size
  - drop down with step values is probably the best
* More keyboard controls! make it so you can type to search the boxes
* Add some holdoff before actually sending commands to the rig, in case of further changes
  - This should (re)start a timer that must elapse before write_rig() is called
* Support for multiple VFOs is not yet usable
* Combined meter view for RX/TX in one line
  - Toggle on click with full view
* Add a settings dialog for configuring key bindings?
* Add QRZ lookup dialog for basic call info
  - Button to paste grid into gridtools dialog
* Implement ncurses or similar TUI
* Add a WSJT-X listener for displaying the messages from WSJT-X
  - Add support to re-sending them to other addresses?
* Maybe move the FM stuff to the right of the rest? or maybe a floating window?
