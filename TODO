**** Add support for forcing front/rear mic when using SIP
* Fix the dragging check around POWER slider and see how to make it keyboard friendly
  - right now it insists on the slider being dragged, to prevent accidental power excursions
* Make the Gridtools button hide/show (not just iconify) the window... Same for logview
  - Also maybe we should add an option to toggle allowing to close the window vs only iconify
* Reduce the amount of rig command sent if possible
  - Instead of polling every control each time, just check PTT and one or two levels
    - Put the controls to poll into an array
    - Increment the counter as polled, wrapping at the end
    - Decide how many to poll per iteration based on the delay, so that controls
      always are polled at least once per tray update
* Find/fix remaining UI bugs
* FreqInput widget:
  - Fix typing in the first digit appearing in last digit!
    - This appears to be related to the fact we immediately write out to hamlib.
      Using some caching + delay before writing the rig should fix this and the latency problems
      when running without flrig
  - while typing, suspend actions on the field and allow typing normally
  - Finish implementing scan mode
    - double click or long click? the up or down to engage
    - rate is set by the slide next to the input
    - set triggered button to ui_button_active color
    - end on ??? Click in window? click in vfo? keypress?
* Tune button (ON/OFF/AUTO)
  - Not sure if this can be implemented
* SIP stuff
  - Implement sip_volume to use baresip volume instead of rig speaker
* Add QRZ lookup dialog for basic call info
  - Button to paste grid into gridtools dialog
* VOX controls with visibility controlled by Use VOX toggle (cfg:use_vox)
* Support for multiple VFOs is not yet usable, clean up and fix it
* Add preamp control
* Add mic gain control
* Add a settings dialog for configuring key bindings?
* Implement ncurses or similar TUI
  - Apply same keybindings to TUI
* Add speech for blind users
* Add signal bar to SWR widget
* Add dropdown to change loglevel in Logview window (maybe just a temporary filter instead of global?)
* Add dialog to spawn modems/etc attached to the audio pipes
  - figure out a way to integrate rnnoise/vst/ladspa plugins into the mic stream for audio processing by script
* Move GTK GUI update code from Hamlib.pm to update() in GTK_ui.pm
* Fix bug where gridtools is shown when main is hidden/show even when hide_gridtools_too is false
* Add more verification/error checking
  - gridtools - Confirm if grids are valid or not
  - FreqInput - Add upper/lower bounds from querying hamlib
* Maybe make blocks able to be pulled out into the own window or returned to main window?
  - Add option to move the meters to a floating window
* Add a widget (scale/slider?) under the freq selector to allow chosing the step size
  - drop down with step values is probably the best
* More keyboard controls! make it so you can type to search the boxes
* Add some holdoff before actually sending commands to the rig, in case of further changes
  - This should (re)start a timer that must elapse before write_rig() is called
* Combined meter view for RX/TX in one line
  - Toggle on click with full view
* Maybe move the FM stuff to the right of the rest? or maybe a floating window?
* Implement support for rigctl via websockets over http/quic
  - Reuse bits from remotepi html5 interface / use bits form here to complete it
  - Create client library for transporting
* Try to sort out the keybindings into a more consistent/intuitive arrangement
* Maybe add some sort of stand alone program which can connect audio from a web sdr instead of remote rig?
