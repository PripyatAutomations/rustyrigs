* Reduce the amount of rig command sent if possible
-----------
* Fix bug where gridtools is shown when main is hidden/show even when hide_gridtools_too is false
* Add more verification/error checking
  - gridtools - Confirm if grids are valid or not
* Clean up read_rig to update $vfos->{$curr_vfo} and call gtk_ui->update()
* Move GTK GUI update code from Hamlib.pm to update() in GTK_ui.pm
* Move anywhere that changes $cfg to use a $tmp_cfg then prompt for confirmation
  - This should go through rr::Settings
* Maybe make blocks able to be pulled out into the own window or returned to main window?
  - how?
* Add option to move the meters to a floating window
* Maybe move the FM stuff to the right of the rest? or maybe a floating window?
* Replace freq slider (gtk3 box with these widgets):
  - numeric entry field
  - up & down buttons
  - step slider
* While transmitting, make the power meter show the RFPOWER meter instead of commanded power
  if possible.
* Add a squelch control
* Add preamp control
* Add mic gain control
* Add DNR/DNF controls
* PTT button & Light
* Add signal bar to SWR widget
  - implement multiple bars (ugh!)
* Add a widget (scale/slider?) under the freq selector to allow chosing the step size
  - drop down with step values is probably the best
* More keyboard controls! make it so you can type to search the boxes
* When user starts typing in the frequency field, suspend actions on the field and allow typing normally
* Replace freq entry with a normal text box, tune up/down buttons, and a step combo
* Add some holdoff before actually sending commands to the rig, in case of further changes
  - This should (re)start a timer that must elapse before write_rig() is called
* Add speech for blind users
* Tune button (ON/OFF/AUTO)
* Support for multiple VFOs is not yet usable
* Combined meter view for RX/TX in one line
  - Toggle on click with full view
* Add a settings dialog for configuring key bindings?
* Add QRZ lookup dialog for basic call info
  - Button to paste grid into gridtools dialog
* Implement ncurses or similar TUI
* Add a WSJT-X listener for displaying the messages from WSJT-X
  - Add support to re-sending them to other addresses?
